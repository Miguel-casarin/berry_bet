# Berry_Bet

 This repository is a collaborative project with my classmates and friends Pietro Marques, Derick1337, and Lincon √Åvila, created for the Programming Languages class in the Computer Engineering program at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande. The idea is to create a betting house with the goal of raising awareness through comedy about the dangers of gambling addiction. 

 The project was developed in Go (Golang) as a way to learn the language, and it also uses some front-end components built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
